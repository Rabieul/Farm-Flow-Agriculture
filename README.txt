Farm Flow: Agricultural Yield Analysis
Overview
Farm Flow: Agricultural Yield Analysis is a machine learning-based project that aims to help farmers predict agricultural yields based on various factors like area, rainfall, fertilizer, and pesticide usage. The project also includes a beginner-friendly crop suggestion feature to help users choose suitable crops based on their season and region. This system is designed to support farmers with data-driven decisions to optimize their farming practices.

Features
Yield Prediction: Predicts the yield of a given crop based on factors such as area, rainfall, fertilizer, and pesticide usage.

Crop Suggestion: Suggests suitable crops based on the selected season and region (new feature for beginners).

Power BI Integration: Visualization of agricultural data and predictions through an interactive Power BI dashboard.

Dataset Viewer: View and filter datasets by crop, state, and season for better insights.

Dark Mode: User interface with dark mode support for comfortable use in different environments.

Installation
Prerequisites
To get started, you'll need to have the following installed:
